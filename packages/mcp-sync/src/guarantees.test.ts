 * #19's acceptance criteria are also its promises, and the reason they are data rather
 * than prose is that `level` is the question AGENTS.md rule 7 asks: could a local check
 * establish this, or does only a real Forguncy project produce the evidence? A green
 * `vp test` here establishes the contract and nothing about Forguncy runtime behaviour,
 * so these tests hold the split as much as the statements.
